#### Initial loading behavior: 

When you visit the live site, you might notice that it loads immediately but appears blurred, and some elements may not be clickable for a period ranging from several seconds to a few minutes. While this behavior may seem unusual, it is completely normal and stems from the following reasons:

- The authorization server is hosted on a free-tier VM within Render.com. This VM operates with minimal resources: 0.1 CPU and 512MB of RAM. To optimize costs, the server goes into sleep mode when inactive.
    - Additionally, when the server wakes, it makes a database connection with a database hosted in a free-tier MongoDB Atlas cluster which has limited resources also and that adds up to the **wake up delay**. 
- Upon loading the page, the React Query initiates a request to `/api/users/me` to verify the user's login status.
- While `isInitialLoading` is `true`, a blur overlay is on top of the Authentication component.
- This request serves to wake up the backend server VM, which requires some time due to its limited resources.
- Subsequent requests to the server may exhibit improved responsiveness, but it's important to anticipate occasional delays in response times.
